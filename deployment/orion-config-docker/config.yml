# bootstrap specifies the method of starting a new node with an empty ledger and database.
bootstrap:
  # method specifies how to use the bootstrap file:
  # - 'genesis' means to load it as the initial configuration that will be converted into the ledger's genesis block and
  #    loaded into the database when the server starts with an empty ledger.
  # - 'join' means to load it as a temporary configuration that will be used to connect to existing cluster members
  #    and on-board by fetching the ledger from them, rebuilding the database in the process (not supported yet).
  method: genesis
  # file contains the initial configuration that will be used to bootstrap the node, as specified by the method, above.
