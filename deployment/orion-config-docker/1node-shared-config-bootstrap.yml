# 1node-shared-config-bootstrap.yml
#
# This file contains the the initial configuration that will be converted into the ledger's genesis block and
# loaded into the database when the server starts with an empty ledger and database.
#
# This part of the configuration is replicated and is common to all nodes.
# After the initial bootstrap, this part of the configuration can change only through configuration transactions.

# nodes carry the identity, endpoint, and certificate of each database node that serves to clients.
# The nodeId correlates the node definition here with the peer definition in the consensus section.
# The host and port are those that are accessible from clients.
# The certificate is the one used to authenticate with clients and sign blocks and transaction/query responses.
nodes:
  - nodeId: orion-server1
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 6001
    certificatePath: /etc/orion-server/crypto/server/server.pem

# consensus carries the definitions of the clustered consensus algorithm, members, and parameters.
consensus:
  # consensus.algorithm denotes the employed consensus
  # algorithm. Currently, only raft consensus is supported
  algorithm: raft
  # members contains the set of servers that take part in consensus.
  # The nodeId correlates the peer definition here with the node definition in the nodes section.
  # The host and port are those that are accessible from other peers.
  members:
    - nodeId: orion-server1
      raftId: 1
      peerHost: raft1.example.com
      peerPort: 7050

  # observers contains the set of servers that are allowed to communicate
  # with consensus.members, and fetch their state.
  observers:
    - nodeId: orion-server4
      raftId: 0
      peerHost: raft4.example.com
      peerPort: 7050

  # consensus.raftConfig carries the configuration parameters that are specific to
  # the etcd/raft library.
  raftConfig:
    # tickInterval is the time interval between two Node.Tick invocations.
    tickInterval: 100ms

    # electionTicks is the number of Node.Tick invocations that must pass
    # between elections. That is, if a follower does not receive any
    # message from the leader of current term before ElectionTick has
    # elapsed, it will become candidate and start an election.
    # electionTicks must be greater than heartbeatTicks.
    electionTicks: 50

    # heartbeatTicks is the number of Node.Tick invocations that must
    # pass between heartbeats. That is, a leader sends heartbeat
    # messages to maintain its leadership every HeartbeatTick ticks.
    heartbeatTicks: 5

    # maxInflightBlocks limits the max number of in-flight blocks (i.e. Raft messages).
    maxInflightBlocks: 50

    # snapshotIntervalSize is the cumulative data size in bytes since last snapshot,
    # after which a new snapshot is taken.

# caConfig defines the paths to the x509 certificates of the root and
# intermediate certificate authorities that issued all the certificates used
# for client facing communication, including signing transactions and blocks.
caConfig:
  # The paths to root certificates. At least one is required. for example:
  #   rootCACertsPath: ./pki/rootcaA.cert, ./pki/rootcaB.cert
  rootCACertsPath: /etc/orion-server/crypto/CA/CA.pem

  # The paths to intermediate certificates. Optional. For example:
  #   intermediateCACertsPath: ./pki/midcaA.cert, ./pki/midcaB.cert

# admin contains the name and certificate of the initial database administrator.
admin:
  # admin.id denotes the id of the cluster admin
  id: admin
  # identity.certificatePath denotes the path
  # to the x509 certificate of the cluster admin
  certificatePath: /etc/orion-server/crypto/admin/admin.pem
